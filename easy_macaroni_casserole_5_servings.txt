  This super easy macaroni casserole is a baked pasta dish with ground turkey, veggies, marinara sauce and cheese. Kid-friendly and no need to pre-cook the pasta! 


  Ingredients 

      * 0.625 lb 93% lean ground turkey 
      * 0.625 tbsp olive oil 
      * 0.625 cup chopped onion 
      * 0.625 medium red pepper (chopped) 
      * 0.15625 cup finely diced celery 
      * 0.15625 cup finely diced carrots 
      * 0.625 cup sliced mushrooms 
      * 0.625 14.5 oz can petite diced tomatoes, drained 
      * 1.25 cups marinara sauce (I used my own homemade) 
      * 1.25 cups water 
      * 0.3125 tsp Italian seasoning 
      * 0.625 tsp Kosher salt 
      * 5 oz shredded mozzarella cheese 
      * 5 oz uncooked DeLallo whole wheat elbows 


  Instructions 

    * In a large deep non-stick skillet, brown the ground turkey over high heat until cooked through, seasoning with a pinch of salt and breaking it up into smaller pieces as it cooks. 
    * Set aside on a dish. 
    * Add olive oil to the skillet, reduce heat to medium and add the onion, red pepper, celery and carrots; sauté until the vegetables soft, about 6 to 7 minutes. 
    * Return the turkey to the skillet along with the remaining ingredients except for the pasta and cheese. 
    * Bring to a boil and then lower heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes. 
    * While simmering, heat oven to 350°F. 
    * Spoon just enough of the turkey/vegetable mixture to cover the bottom of a 9x13 pan. 
    * Cover with uncooked pasta. 
    * Spoon remaining sauce mixture evenly over the top and sprinkle with cheese. 
    * Cover with foil and bake 50-55 minutes. 
    * Remove from oven and let stand, covered, for 15 minutes. 
    * Divide into 5 servings.
