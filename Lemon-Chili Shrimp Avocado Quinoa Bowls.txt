  Instructions

     * Cook the quinoa: Bring broth to a boil in a medium heavy pot. Rinse
       quinoa under cold water and drain well. Lower heat and cook, covered,
       for 25 minutes. Turn off heat and let rest, covered, for 5 minutes.
       Fluff with a fork.
     * For the shrimp: While the quinoa is cooking, add 2 teaspoons of the
       olive oil, half of the lemon juice, half of the lemon zest, oregano,
       parsley, garlic, chili, salt and pepper to a small bowl and mix well.
       Add the shrimp and toss.
     * Heat a grill pan or heavy skillet over high heat. When hot, spray with
       oil and add the shrimp. Cook 2 to 3 minutes on each side.
     * Divide greens into 4 large serving bowls on one half of the dish.
     * Add half the quinoa to the other half, then top with shrimp, avocado,
       tomato, and onion.
     * Drizzle each salad with 1 teaspoon of the remaining olive oil, salt,
       pepper, red chili flakes and drizzle with remaining lemon juice.
