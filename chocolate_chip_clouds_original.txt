       large bowl at high speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar a
       little at a time, then vanilla, beating well after each addition until
       you get stiff peaks, the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is glossy.
     * Sift cocoa onto egg white mixture; gently fold until combined.
