  Instructions

     * In a large deep non-stick skillet, brown the ground turkey over high
       heat until cooked through, seasoning with a pinch of salt and breaking
       it up into smaller pieces as it cooks.
     * Set aside on a dish.
     * Add olive oil to the skillet, reduce heat to medium and add the onion,
       red pepper, celery and carrots; sauté until the vegetables soft, about
       6 to 7 minutes.
     * Return the turkey to the skillet along with the remaining ingredients
       except for the pasta and cheese.
     * Bring to a boil and then lower heat to medium-low and simmer for 20
       minutes.
     * While simmering, heat oven to 350°F.
     * Spoon just enough of the turkey/vegetable mixture to cover the bottom
       of a 9x13 pan.
     * Cover with uncooked pasta.
     * Spoon remaining sauce mixture evenly over the top and sprinkle with
       cheese.
     * Cover with foil and bake 50-55 minutes.
     * Remove from oven and let stand, covered, for 15 minutes.
     * Divide into 8 servings.
